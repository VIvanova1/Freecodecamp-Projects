            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
                control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing
                it with additional objects; for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond
                        to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <h2>What you should already know</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>
                <h2>Hello world</h2>
            </header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>
                <h2>Constants
                </h2>
            </header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or
                underscore characters.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.<br> The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable. <br> You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
            <code>  // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                    WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                    //statements }
            </code>
            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue";
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>
                <h2>While statement</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.<br> The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement
                is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                <br> To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                <br> Example:
                <br> The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &#60; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>

            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n &#60; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
